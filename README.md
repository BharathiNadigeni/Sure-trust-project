**Executive Summary**

The Student Placement Data Analysis Dashboard project aims to analyze placement data for SURE Trust students using Power BI to uncover trends and identify key academic factors affecting placement outcomes.

**Introduction**

**Data Science:**
Data science involves extracting meaningful insights from large datasets using various techniques, including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling. The power of data science is leveraged in this project to provide actionable insights.

In this project, Power BI is used to visualize trends and analyze student placement outcomes based on various factors like academic performance, stream, and college.

**Problem Statement:**
The primary challenge is to gain a deeper understanding of placement trends based on different academic and demographic factors, thus aiding SURE Trust in improving placement strategies and supporting students effectively.

**Project Objectives**

- **Trend Analysis:** Identify placement trends by department, course, and academic performance.
- **Demographic Insights:** Analyze placement success based on factors such as gender, region, and qualification.
- **KPI Reporting:** Create key performance indicators (KPIs) for placement success based on historical data.
- **Actionable Insights:** Provide suggestions for improving placement success rates and identifying areas for further academic development.

**Methodology & Results**

**Tools/Software Used:**

- **Power BI:** Used for data visualization, dashboard creation, and report generation.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Used for creating calculated columns, KPIs, and aggregating data.
- **Excel/Sheets:** Used for initial data cleaning and preprocessing before importing into Power BI.

**Data Collection Approach:**

The dataset includes various student metrics like academic scores, placement status, and demographic information (gender, region, qualification).

Data was gathered from internal SURE Trust databases and processed for analysis using Power BI.

**Project Architecture:**

- **Data Collection:** Data was collected from internal placement records and academic performance data.
- **Data Processing:** The raw data was cleaned, formatted, and imported into Power BI for analysis.
- **Data Visualization:** Interactive dashboards were created in Power BI to provide insights into placement success.
- **Reporting:** Generated reports to visualize placement trends, helping SURE Trust make data-driven decisions.

**Social/Industry Relevance of the Project**

This project provides valuable insights into student placement trends, helping educational institutions improve their strategies to boost placement rates. By analyzing placement data, the project contributes to both social and industry growth.

**Learning & Reflection**

This project helped refine my skills in Power BI for data analysis and visualization. The hands-on experience with DAX and dashboard design provided an understanding of how to present data-driven insights effectively
